# Components

This directory contains reusable React components that can be used throughout the application.

## Structure

- Keep components modular and focused on a single responsibility
- Each component should have its own directory if it includes multiple files (styles, tests, etc.)
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## Example

```
components/
├── Button/
│   ├── Button.tsx
│   ├── Button.test.tsx
│   └── Button.css
└── Card/
    ├── Card.tsx
    └── Card.test.tsx
```
